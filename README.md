Espresso - 1.7.10
===========

This is my horrific attempt at optimizing and making production ready server software for legacy minecraft versions (1.5.2-1.8.8) 
DO NOT USE THIS FOR YOUR OWN SERVER, IT IS NOWHERE NEAR GOOD OR READY FOR PRODUCTION, THIS IS JUST SOMETHING I DO IN MY FREE TIME

Espresso-1.7 uses the latest spigot commit from bitbucket, prior to updating to 1.8

Compilation
-----------

We use maven to handle our dependencies.

* Install [Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/download.html)
* You're also gonna need craftbukkit, minecraft_server (mcdev) and bukkit
* https://tinyurl.com/1710mcnms
* https://github.com/Bukkit/Bukkit 
* https://github.com/fourtey/CraftBukkit 

* *Note*: I have removed specialsource, or overmapped depending on the version, and as a result this will not work with the legacy bukkit-api methods, only the latest ones
